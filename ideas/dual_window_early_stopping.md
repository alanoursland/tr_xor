# Relative-Trend Early Stopping: A Dual-Window Approach

## 1. Motivation
Early stopping is a widely used regularization and efficiency technique in machine learning.  
The most common method—**patience-based stopping**—monitors a validation metric and halts training if it fails to improve for a fixed number of epochs.  
However, patience criteria:
- Are sensitive to noise in the validation metric.
- Require arbitrary hyperparameters that do not generalize well across datasets and architectures.
- Can stop too early (false positive) or too late (wasting compute).

We propose **Relative-Trend Early Stopping (RTES)**, a simple yet robust alternative that compares *two moving averages* of the validation metric to determine when progress has stalled.

## 2. Method

### 2.1 Overview
RTES maintains:
- **Short window** average \( M_s(t) \): captures recent performance trend.
- **Long window** average \( M_\ell(t) \): captures the broader historical baseline.

Training continues only if the short window average is **better** than the long window average by more than a margin \(\delta_t\).

---

### 2.2 Formal Definition
Let \(y_t\) be the validation metric at epoch \(t\) (e.g., accuracy, F1; for loss, reverse inequalities).

Short window:
\[
M_s(t) = \frac{1}{w_s} \sum_{i=0}^{w_s-1} y_{t-i}
\]
Long window:
\[
M_\ell(t) = \frac{1}{w_\ell} \sum_{i=0}^{w_\ell-1} y_{t-i}, \quad w_s < w_\ell
\]

Stop condition (for higher-is-better metrics):
\[
M_s(t) \le M_\ell(t) + \delta_t
\]
For loss metrics, reverse the sign.

---

### 2.3 Margin Calibration
We define \(\delta_t\) based on estimated metric noise:
\[
\hat\sigma_t = \text{std deviation of residuals in } M_\ell(t)
\]
\[
\delta_t = z_\alpha \, \hat\sigma_t \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{w_s} + \tfrac{1}{w_\ell}}
\]
where \(z_\alpha\) corresponds to a desired false-stop probability (e.g., \(z_{0.05} \approx 1.64\) for 5% one-sided).

This turns the margin into a statistically interpretable parameter, reducing manual tuning.

---

### 2.4 Optional Enhancements
- **Patience overlay**: require the stop condition to hold for \(p\) consecutive epochs.
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**: replace simple averages with EMA for smoother trend detection.
- **Adaptive windows**: increase \(w_\ell\) as training progresses for a more stable baseline.

---

## 3. Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```python
initialize short_window_buffer, long_window_buffer
for epoch t in range(1, T+1):
    train_one_epoch()
    y_t = evaluate_on_validation()
    update_rolling_means(Ms, Ml)
    σ_hat = estimate_noise(long_window_buffer)
    δ_t = z_alpha * σ_hat * sqrt(1/w_s + 1/w_l)
    if Ms <= Ml + δ_t for p consecutive epochs:
        stop_training()
````

## 4. Experimental Plan

### 4.1 Baselines

* Patience-based stopping (various patience and min\_delta).
* EMA-smoothed patience.
* Training-loss plateau.
* Bayesian/SPRT stopping.
* Fixed-epoch schedule (oracle from pilot runs).

### 4.2 Tasks & Datasets

* **Vision**: CIFAR-10/100 (ResNet-18), Tiny-ImageNet (WRN-28-10).
* **NLP**: SST-2, AG-News (DistilBERT fine-tuning).
* **Tabular**: 3–4 UCI datasets (XGBoost/LightGBM).
* **Optional**: time series forecasting (M4 subset, LSTM/TFT).

### 4.3 Metrics

**Effectiveness**

* Test metric at stop (accuracy/F1/MAE).
* Generalization gap: $y_\text{train} - y_\text{test}$ at stop.
* Stopping regret: $y_\text{oracle} - y_\text{stop}$.

**Efficiency**

* Epochs to stop / wall-clock time.
* Compute saved at equal performance.

**Robustness**

* Variance across seeds.
* Premature/late stop rates.
* Sensitivity to $(w_s, w_\ell, z_\alpha)$.

## 5. Expected Contributions

1. **A new early stopping rule** that:

   * Is robust to noisy or oscillatory validation metrics.
   * Requires minimal hyperparameter tuning across domains.
   * Is easy to implement in existing frameworks.

2. **Empirical evidence** across multiple domains showing:

   * Equal or better test performance than patience-based stopping.
   * Reduced variance in stopping epoch.
   * Significant compute savings.

## 6. Naming and Publication Notes

We refer to this method as **Relative-Trend Early Stopping (RTES)** or **Dual-Window Early Stopping**.
The key novelty is the *relative trend comparison* rather than *absolute best-so-far improvement*.
This framing connects to **change-point detection** and **signal detection theory**, enabling both theoretical and empirical justification.
