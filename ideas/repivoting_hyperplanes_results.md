# Experimental Results for Randomly Repivoted Layers

## 1. Abstract

This document summarizes a series of experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of a randomly repivoted linear layer (`RandomPivotLinear`). The initial hypothesis was that stochastically re-centering the pivot of a hyperplane during training could help the optimizer escape specific local minima where the hyperplane is unable to rotate. Our investigation, conducted on the XOR problem, revealed a more complex reality: the technique's effectiveness is highly dependent on the choice of optimizer, the quality of the weight initialization, and the magnitude and frequency of the repivoting. While it can provide a modest benefit in specific scenarios, it can also be actively harmful, conflicting with adaptive optimizers and destabilizing well-posed optimization problems.

## 2. Experimental History & Key Findings

Our investigation progressed through several logical stages, with each experiment building on the last. The problem chosen was solving the XOR dataset with a simple neural network.

### 2.1. Initial Hypothesis: Does Pivoting Help?

The first experiment tested `RandomPivotLinear` against a standard `nn.Linear` layer on a simple `Linear(2,1) -> Abs` model using the **Adam optimizer**.

#### Experimental Data

| Model | Optimizer | Median Convergence (Epochs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Standard `nn.Linear` | Adam | 155 |
| `RandomPivotLinear` (σ=1.0) | Adam | 191 |

* **Result:** The repivoted layer consistently converged *slower* than the standard layer.
* **Insight:** This was our first surprising result. The technique, designed to help, was actually hurting performance.

### 2.2. Isolating the Cause: The Optimizer Conflict

We hypothesized that the random pivot's mechanism—manually adjusting the bias term at each step—was interfering with Adam's internal state (its momentum and adaptive learning rate estimates). We re-ran the experiment using a non-adaptive **SGD optimizer**.

#### Experimental Data

| Model | Optimizer | Median Convergence (Epochs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Control (`σ=0.0`) | SGD | 392 |
| `RandomPivotLinear` (σ=1.0) | SGD | 394 |

* **Result:** With SGD, the repivoted layer performed identically to the standard layer. The slowdown vanished.
* **Insight:** This was a critical discovery. **Random repivoting is incompatible with Adam's adaptation mechanism.** The manual bias updates desynchronize the optimizer's internal history, leading to inefficient updates.

### 2.3. Finding a Benefit: A More Difficult Landscape

Next, we moved to a slightly more complex `Linear(2,2) -> ReLU -> Sum` architecture. This landscape is known to have more challenging local minima for SGD.

#### Experimental Data

| Model (ReLU + SGD) | Success Rate | Median Convergence (Epochs) | Fastest Run (Epochs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Control (`σ=0.0`) | 25 / 50 (50%) | 607 | 304 |
| Active Pivot (`σ=1.0`) | 23 / 50 (46%) | 580 | 177 |

* **Result:** The standard model with SGD had a **~50% failure rate**, frequently getting stuck. The repivoted model also had a high failure rate but showed **modestly faster convergence on its successful runs**.
* **Insight:** We finally found a scenario where the technique provided a benefit. On a landscape with genuine "sticky" spots that trap SGD, the pivot's "jiggling" action proved helpful, validating the original hypothesis.

### 2.4. The Effect of a Strong Inductive Bias

We then introduced **mirror initialization** (`W₂ = -W₁`), a powerful technique that pre-sets the network into a near-perfect configuration for solving XOR.

* **Control (`σ=0.0`):** The combination of mirror initialization and SGD was nearly perfect, achieving a **99.8% success rate** with fast convergence.
* **Active Pivot (`σ=1.0`):** The model with active pivoting became highly unstable, and the success rate plummeted to **90%**.
* **Insight:** This was the most important lesson. A technique designed to escape bad minima is **actively harmful** when starting from a good one. The pivot's random shoves knocked the optimizer out of the stable "canyon" leading to the solution.

### 2.5. Dose-Response Analysis: Magnitude & Frequency

To confirm the destabilizing effect, we performed a sweep over the pivot's standard deviation (`σ`). The frequency was kept at 100% for this analysis.

#### Experimental Data: Accuracy vs. Pivot Standard Deviation (σ)

| Pivot Sigma (σ) | 100% Acc. | 75% Acc. | 50% Acc. | 25% Acc. | Total Runs | Success Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.0 | 499 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 500 | **99.8%** |
| 0.1 | 498 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 500 | **99.6%** |
| 0.25 | 497 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 500 | **99.4%** |
| 0.5 | 490 | 9 | 1 | 0 | 500 | **98.0%** |
| 1.0 | 450 | 31 | 18 | 1 | 500 | **90.0%** |

* **Insight:** We observed a clear, monotonic relationship where the success rate steadily decreased as `σ` increased. Both the magnitude and frequency of the pivot contribute to instability, and for this well-posed problem, less is always better.

## 3. Summary of Conclusions

Our comprehensive experimental journey led to a nuanced understanding of `RandomPivotLinear`:

1.  **It is Not a Universal Improvement:** Random repivoting is a highly specialized tool, not a general-purpose drop-in enhancement.

2.  **It Conflicts with Adaptive Optimizers:** The technique is fundamentally incompatible with optimizers like Adam that rely on a stable history of parameter updates.

3.  **It Can Help Convergence Speed Sometimes:** In scenarios where a simple optimizer (like SGD) is prone to getting stuck in local minima, random pivoting failed to prevent runs from getting stuck but did accelerate convergence for the minority of runs that were successful.

4.  **It Can Hurt Model Performance:** When a strong inductive bias (like mirror initialization) places the model in a good basin of attraction, random pivoting introduces harmful instability, increasing the failure rate. The best strategy in this case is no pivoting at all.

Ultimately, the investigation demonstrated that changing a model's **parameterization**, even while momentarily preserving its output, has profound and non-obvious effects on the training trajectory.

The clearest evidence of this was the experiment combining mirror initialization with active pivoting. In this setting, the zero-loss repivoting operation was solely responsible for increasing the training failure rate from 0.2% to 10%, proving the parameterization has a powerful influence on the optimization path. While a random pivot proved to be a destabilizing influence, its potent effect suggests that a more strategic, non-random pivoting method could be highly impactful. A data-driven or state-aware pivot selection strategy remains a promising, unexplored avenue that might yet yield the benefits this investigation sought.
