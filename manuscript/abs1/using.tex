\section{Using This Chapter}
\label{sec:abs1-using}

This chapter is written to serve two kinds of readers at once:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The survey reader} who wants the headline results and their
          conceptual implications.
    \item \textbf{The detail-oriented reader} who wishes to trace every number
          back to its experimental source.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Navigation Tips}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Skim or dive}: Each numbered section opens with a boldface
          paragraph that summarises its main message; the rest can be read
          selectively.
    \item \textbf{Cross-references}: When a statement relies on theory developed
          elsewhere, we reference the relevant chapter or appendix section.  No
          background beyond what is cited is assumed.
    \item \textbf{Per-chapter bibliography}: References that appear in this
          chapter are listed immediately after the chapter (see the end of the
          document).  Citations from other chapters do not clutter this list.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Legend for Mini-Reports}

Throughout Sections~\ref{sec:abs1-init} and~\ref{sec:abs1-optim} you will
encounter standardized mini-reports.  Each follows the same template:

\begin{description}
  \item[Header] Experiment tag and one-sentence description.
  \item[Convergence Table]   Five-quantile summary of epochs required to reach
        an MSE below \(10^{-7}\).
  \item[Geometry Summary]  Count of distinct hyperplane clusters and average
        distance of class--1 points to the learned surface.
\end{description}

This uniform layout lets you compare variants at a glance, while fuller plots
and diagnostic statistics reside in the appendix.
