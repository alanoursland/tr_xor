\section{Activation Study}
\label{sec:relu1-activations}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Study Motivation}

The baseline study identified dead data as the primary failure mode limiting coordination success to 48\%. When True class points have negative pre-activation across both ReLU units, they cannot contribute gradient signals for error correction, creating asymmetric learning that prevents discovery of the required mirror symmetry. This analysis suggests a straightforward theoretical solution: providing any gradient on the negative side should prevent gradient vanishing and maintain learning signals from all data points.

Before developing complex intervention strategies, we evaluate whether existing activation function innovations can eliminate the coordination problem entirely. Modern deep learning employs sophisticated activation functions—ELU, PReLU, and various LeakyReLU configurations—that have become standard practice for addressing gradient flow issues in deep networks. Testing these established solutions provides both a practical baseline and research completeness, ensuring that any coordination study evaluates current best practices before proposing novel approaches.

The research questions are threefold: Can activation function modifications eliminate dead data failures? How do modern activations perform on minimal coordination tasks? Does providing negative-side gradients validate the dead data failure mechanism? These questions address both theoretical understanding and practical guidance, establishing whether coordination challenges require specialized techniques or can be resolved with existing tools.

This experiment represents the simplest possible intervention—zero implementation cost activation changes—providing a natural comparison point for more elaborate re-initialization and monitoring strategies. If standard activation functions solve the coordination problem, this establishes an immediate practical solution while confirming the gradient flow hypothesis. If they provide partial improvement, the degree of success quantifies the contribution of the dead data mechanism versus other coordination challenges.

The theoretical framework predicts that any negative-side gradient should dramatically improve success rates by preserving learning signals from all inputs. Furthermore, negative leak variants that approximate the absolute value function more closely should show increased mirror symmetry and higher success rates, providing a smooth transition from pure ReLU coordination challenges toward the deterministic success of the hard-coded absolute value approach.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Study Design}

\paragraph{Model Architecture}
All experiments employ the same two-ReLU architecture as the baseline study: Linear(2→2) → Activation → Sum, maintaining 6 trainable parameters in the linear layer. The only modification is the replacement of the pure ReLU activation function, allowing direct attribution of performance differences to activation choice rather than architectural changes.

\paragraph{Activation Function Variants}
The experimental design tests three activation function types across eight specific configurations, selected for their theoretical relevance to the coordination problem and their relationship to the prototype surface learning framework.

\textbf{LeakyReLU with systematic parameter exploration.} Six variants systematically explore the functional spectrum defined by $\text{LeakyReLU}(z, \alpha) = \text{ReLU}(z) + \alpha \cdot \text{ReLU}(-z)$, where $\alpha$ represents the negative slope parameter. The tested values ($\alpha = 0.8, 0.1, 0.01, -0.01, -0.1, -0.8$) create a continuum from approaches to the linear function $y = z$ (at $\alpha = 1.0$), through standard positive leaks designed to prevent dying ReLU problems, past pure ReLU ($\alpha = 0.0$ baseline), to negative leaks that progressively approximate the absolute value function (at $\alpha = -1.0$). This systematic exploration allows direct observation of how coordination success and geometric patterns evolve along the linear-to-absolute-value spectrum.

\textbf{PReLU as adaptive LeakyReLU.} PReLU introduces a learnable negative slope parameter, initialized at $0.01$, allowing the network to adaptively discover the optimal activation shape during training. This provides insight into what slope values the network finds most effective for coordination tasks, potentially revealing whether learned parameters converge toward the negative leak values that facilitate mirror symmetry discovery.

\textbf{ELU as smooth alternative.} ELU employs an exponential negative tail that eliminates the sharp zero-crossing of ReLU-family activations. While this prevents dead data through continuous gradient flow, it complicates prototype surface interpretation—the effective prototype surface passing through class-0 points exists but cannot be directly identified from the model parameters, unlike the geometric transparency of piecewise-linear activations.

\paragraph{Training Protocol}
Standard activation variants (positive leaks, ELU, PReLU) employ the established protocol: Kaiming initialization, Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.01, and 800-epoch budget. Negative leak variants use enhanced training configurations—Adam with learning rate 0.1 and 5000-epoch budget—anticipating potentially slower convergence as these activations approach the absolute value function's coordination requirements. All experiments maintain 50 independent runs per variant for statistical reliability.

\paragraph{Hypothesis Testing Framework}
The experimental design tests multiple coordinated hypotheses. Primary prediction: any negative-side gradient should eliminate dead data failures, dramatically improving success rates over the 48\% baseline. Secondary prediction: negative leak performance should correlate with proximity to the absolute value function, with $\alpha = -0.8$ showing stronger mirror symmetry than $\alpha = -0.01$. Modern activation validation: ELU and PReLU should achieve high success rates through their gradient preservation properties. Adaptive learning: PReLU should discover negative slope values that facilitate coordination.

\paragraph{Analysis Framework}
The analysis employs the same geometric and coordination metrics as the baseline study, enhanced with activation-specific diagnostics. Success rate comparison across the activation spectrum provides validation of the gradient flow hypothesis. Mirror weight symmetry analysis quantifies coordination quality improvements. Dead data analysis confirms the mechanism by which alternative activations prevent initial failure modes. For PReLU experiments, learned parameter evolution tracking reveals whether the network discovers coordination-facilitating slope values during training.

\subsection*{Success Metrics}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Classification accuracy comparison across activation functions (50 runs each).}
\label{tab:relu1-activation-success}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Activation & Success Rate & Performance vs Baseline \\
\midrule
ReLU (Baseline) & 24/50 (48\%) & -- \\
LeakyReLU 0.8 & 44/50 (88\%) & +83\% relative \\
LeakyReLU 0.1 & 47/50 (94\%) & +96\% relative \\
LeakyReLU 0.01 & 38/50 (76\%) & +58\% relative \\
LeakyReLU -0.01 & 48/50 (96\%) & +100\% relative \\
LeakyReLU -0.1 & 45/50 (90\%) & +88\% relative \\
LeakyReLU -0.8 & 46/50 (92\%) & +92\% relative \\
ELU & 48/50 (96\%) & +100\% relative \\
PReLU & 48/50 (96\%) & +100\% relative \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Every activation function modification dramatically outperforms the pure ReLU baseline, with success rates ranging from 76\% to 96\% compared to the baseline's 48\%. This universal improvement validates the dead data hypothesis: providing any gradient signal on the negative side of the activation function prevents the gradient vanishing that causes coordination failures.

The performance spectrum reveals clear patterns across activation types. Positive leak variants show variable improvement, with moderate leaks (0.1) achieving 94\% success while smaller leaks (0.01) reach only 76\%. Negative leak variants demonstrate strong performance across all tested slopes, with the smallest negative leak (-0.01) achieving optimal 96\% success. Modern activation functions—ELU and PReLU—both reach the highest performance tier at 96\% success, confirming their effectiveness for coordination-dependent tasks.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Failure pattern analysis across activation functions.}
\label{tab:relu1-activation-failures}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
Activation & 25\% Acc & 50\% Acc & 75\% Acc & 100\% Acc & Failure Pattern \\
\midrule
ReLU (Baseline) & 0 & 0 & 26 & 24 & 75\% plateau \\
LeakyReLU 0.8 & 0 & 6 & 0 & 44 & 50\% plateau \\
LeakyReLU 0.1 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 47 & 75\% plateau \\
LeakyReLU 0.01 & 0 & 0 & 12 & 38 & 75\% plateau \\
ELU & 2 & 0 & 0 & 48 & 25\% plateau \\
PReLU & 0 & 2 & 0 & 48 & 50\% plateau \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The failure pattern analysis reveals that different activation functions not only reduce failure rates but also alter the nature of remaining failures. While the ReLU baseline shows a consistent 75\% accuracy plateau, alternative activations introduce different failure modes: large positive leaks create 50\% plateaus, ELU produces rare 25\% failures, and most variants eliminate the persistent 75\% trap entirely.

These results provide compelling evidence that the coordination problem can be solved through simple architectural modifications rather than complex intervention strategies. The minimum 58\% relative improvement (LeakyReLU 0.01) and maximum 100\% improvement (ELU, PReLU, LeakyReLU -0.01) demonstrate that any deviation from pure ReLU significantly enhances coordination learning. The strong performance of negative leak variants, which progressively approximate the absolute value function, confirms the theoretical prediction that coordination improves as the activation approaches the $|z| = \operatorname{ReLU}(z) + \operatorname{ReLU}(-z)$ identity.

\subsection*{Learning Dynamics}

\caption{Convergence timing for successful runs (100\% accuracy only, epochs to MSE < $10^{-7}$).}
\label{tab:relu1-activation-timing}
\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}

\multicolumn{5}{c}{Epoch percentile} & \multirow{2}{*}{Count} \\
\cmidrule(lr){2-6}
 & 0\,\% & 25\,\% & 50\,\% & 75\,\% & 100\,\% & \\
\midrule
ReLU (Baseline) & 53 & 126 & 190 & 251 & 336 & 24/50 \\
LeakyReLU 0.8 & 634 & 800 & 800 & 800 & 800 & 44/50 \\
LeakyReLU 0.1 & 28 & 206 & 293 & 376 & 672 & 47/50 \\
LeakyReLU 0.01 & 32 & 182 & 357 & 694 & 800 & 38/50 \\
LeakyReLU -0.01 & 33 & 238 & 2861 & 3064 & 3319 & 48/50 \\
LeakyReLU -0.1 & 14 & 33 & 86 & 176 & 302 & 45/50 \\
LeakyReLU -0.8 & 16 & 29 & 42 & 78 & 354 & 46/50 \\
ELU & 80 & 221 & 351 & 417 & 569 & 48/50 \\
PReLU & 44 & 169 & 442 & 728 & 1014 & 48/50 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Convergence timing for successful coordination reveals striking patterns across the activation spectrum. The fastest convergence occurs with LeakyReLU -0.8 (median 42 epochs), which most closely approximates the absolute value function. This rapid coordination discovery reflects the activation's built-in bias toward the V-shaped response pattern required for XOR classification.

Conversely, LeakyReLU -0.01 shows the slowest convergence (median 2861 epochs) despite achieving high success rates. This suggests that minimal negative slopes provide sufficient gradient flow to prevent dead data failures but offer little assistance in coordination discovery, requiring extensive exploration to find the mirror-symmetric solution.

Modern activation functions demonstrate moderate convergence speeds, with ELU achieving median convergence at 351 epochs and PReLU at 442 epochs. Both significantly outpace the problematic positive leak variants: LeakyReLU 0.8 frequently exhausts the training budget, while smaller positive leaks (0.01, 0.1) show variable timing with many runs requiring extended training.

The timing patterns reveal a clear trade-off between coordination assistance and learning efficiency. Activations that more closely approximate the absolute value function (negative leaks approaching -1.0) enable faster coordination discovery when they do converge, while those providing minimal architectural bias require more extensive optimization to achieve the same geometric relationships. This reinforces that the coordination challenge fundamentally involves discovering the relationship between independent components rather than optimizing individual neuron performance.

\subsection*{Geometric Analysis}

The geometric analysis reveals how different activation functions affect the coordinate solutions and prototype surface structures learned by successful runs. While all variants ultimately achieve successful coordination, they demonstrate varying degrees of geometric consistency and mirror symmetry detection.

ReLU (Baseline) & $0.32 \pm 0.21$ & $1.37 \pm 0.05$ & 1 & 48 \\
LeakyReLU 0.8 & $0.01 \pm 0.01$ & $1.41 \pm 0.00$ & 1 & 88 \\

ELU & $0.45 \pm 0.16$ & $1.36 \pm 0.06$ & 1 & 96 \\
PReLU & $0.24 \pm 0.22$ & $1.38 \pm 0.04$ & 2 & 96 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Mirror weight symmetry and clustering analysis across activation functions.}
\label{tab:relu1-activation-symmetry}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Activation & Mirror Pairs & Perfect Mirrors & Weight Clusters & Noise Points \\

ReLU (Baseline) & 16/50 & 3 & 9 & 10 \\
LeakyReLU 0.8 & 44/44 & 44 & 4 & 6 \\
LeakyReLU 0.1 & 47/50 & 11 & 9 & 9 \\
LeakyReLU 0.01 & 23/50 & 3 & 8 & 7 \\

LeakyReLU -0.8 & 16/50 & 13 & 1 & 6 \\
ELU & 48/48 & 42 & 22 & 26 \\
PReLU & 19/48 & 16 & 16 & 22 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The distance pattern analysis confirms that successful coordination maintains the core prototype surface relationship across activation variants, with False class points positioned near learned hyperplanes and True class points at distances around $\sqrt{2}$. Negative leak variants show increased geometric diversity, producing multiple distance clusters that represent different valid coordination strategies.

The mirror weight symmetry analysis reveals the most striking activation-dependent pattern. Large positive leaks (LeakyReLU 0.8) and ELU achieve near-perfect mirror symmetry detection (44/44 and 42/48 perfect mirrors), strongly biasing networks toward the theoretical $w^{(1)} = -w^{(0)}$ relationship. Conversely, negative leak variants show surprisingly low mirror detection rates despite high success rates. Their absolute value approximation enables alternative solutions without perfect parameter symmetry.

This divergence highlights a key finding: successful coordination can emerge through multiple geometric pathways. Some activations promote convergence to the theoretical mirror-symmetric ideal, while others enable diverse but equally effective coordination strategies. The activation choice determines not only success rates but also the interpretability of the learned solution—piecewise-linear activations maintain clear geometric relationships between parameters and prototype surfaces, while smooth activations like ELU achieve coordination through mechanisms that are less directly interpretable from the model weights alone.

\paragraph{Adaptive Activation Learning Validates Theoretical Predictions}
The PReLU experiments provide compelling evidence that networks, when given the freedom to learn their activation shape, independently discover the theoretical optimum. Analysis of the learned negative slope parameters reveals a clear preference for values approaching the absolute value function. Once the absolute value is approximated the problem can be solved by a single node.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{PReLU learned parameter clustering (48 successful runs).}
\label{tab:relu1-prelu-learned}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
Cluster & Size & Learned $\alpha$ (mean $\pm$ std) & Interpretation \\
\midrule
0 & 20 & $-1.003 \pm 0.009$ & Near-perfect abs function \\
3 & 13 & $0.276 \pm 0.116$ & Positive leak \\
2 & 7 & $-0.004 \pm 0.008$ & Near-zero (ReLU-like) \\
1 & 6 & $-0.354 \pm 0.029$ & Intermediate negative leak \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The largest cluster (20/48 runs) converged to $\alpha = -1.003$, essentially recreating the perfect absolute value function and validating the $|z| = \operatorname{ReLU}(z) + \operatorname{ReLU}(-z)$ identity as the optimal coordination mechanism. This finding aligns with work by Pinto and Tavares~\cite{pinto2024prelu}, who demonstrated that PReLU with $\alpha = -1$ can solve XOR in a single layer by implementing the absolute value function. The remaining clusters demonstrate bimodal learning, with networks discovering either positive leaks or negative leaks while actively avoiding the pure ReLU region. This adaptive parameter discovery confirms that negative slopes approaching $-1.0$ represent the optimal activation shape for two-component coordination tasks, providing independent validation of both the theoretical framework and the systematic LeakyReLU exploration.

\subsection*{Study Discussion}

This reinitialization study provides compelling validation that dead data represents the primary bottleneck limiting coordination success in the baseline configuration. The dramatic improvement from 48\% to 92\% success through basic dead data elimination confirms that ensuring gradient flow from all data points is both necessary and highly effective for reliable coordination learning. The intervention's simplicity—requiring only initialization screening with no architectural or training modifications—demonstrates that coordination challenges can often be addressed through careful attention to starting conditions rather than complex algorithmic interventions.

The discovery of a secondary failure mode reveals important nuances in coordination learning dynamics. Analysis of the 4 failed runs from basic reinitialization showed hyperplanes positioned extremely close to individual data points, creating geometric vulnerabilities where networks can enter dead states during training despite clean initialization. This proximity-based failure mechanism highlights that successful coordination requires not only active initialization but also sufficient geometric margins to maintain stability throughout optimization.

The margin requirement intervention validates this geometric hypothesis through its ten-fold failure reduction from 8\% to 0.8\%. The 0.3 activation threshold effectively prevents proximity-based vulnerabilities while maintaining reasonable sampling efficiency, demonstrating that targeted geometric constraints can systematically address specific failure modes. The persistence of residual failures at 0.8\% indicates that some coordination challenges may be inherent to the geometric relationships between XOR data and hyperplane positioning, suggesting limits to initialization-based interventions.

The geometric analysis provides strong support for prototype surface learning theory. Clean initialization promotes discovery of the theoretically predicted mirror-symmetric solutions, with mirror pair detection improving from 32\% in the baseline to 88\% with margin requirements. The progressive consolidation of weight space solutions—from 9 clusters in the baseline to 5 dominant clusters with margins—demonstrates that eliminating problematic starting conditions channels networks toward higher-quality coordination patterns consistent with theoretical predictions.

These results establish initialization quality as a critical factor in coordination learning, with implications extending beyond the specific XOR task. The systematic improvement through dead data elimination and margin requirements suggests that geometric design principles should inform initialization strategies for coordination-dependent architectures. The near-perfect reliability achieved through simple screening interventions provides a practical foundation for applications requiring dependable coordination learning while establishing baseline performance for more sophisticated intervention strategies.
