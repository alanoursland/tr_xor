\section{Bounded Hypersphere Initialization Study}
\label{sec:relu1-bounded-hypersphere}

\subsection*{Motivation}
Dead-data re-initialisation (previous section) \emph{rejects} bad weight
draws until every input is active.  
Bounded-hypersphere (BHS) initialisation tries to achieve the same goal
\emph{constructively}: each hidden hyperplane is placed
\emph{tangent} to a hypersphere of radius $r=1.4$
centred on the data mean, with its normal pointing inward.
All four XOR points therefore start on the positive side of
\(\operatorname{ReLU}(w\!\cdot\!x+b)\) and provide non-zero gradients
from the first step onward.

\subsection*{Classification Accuracy}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Accuracy over 50 runs with BHS ($r=1.4$).}
\label{tab:relu1-bhs-accuracy}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
Accuracy & 0\,\% & 25\,\% & 50\,\% & 75\,\% & 100\,\% \\
\midrule
Runs & 0 & 1 & 10 & 0 & 39 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Outcome.}
Success improves from the ReLU baseline's $48\,\%$ to $78\,\%$ (39 of 50 runs).

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Convergence Timing}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Epochs to early-stop for the 39 successful runs.}
\label{tab:relu1-bhs-epochs}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
Percentile & 0\,\% & 25\,\% & 50\,\% & 75\,\% & 100\,\% \\
\midrule
Epochs & 258 & 571 & 666 & 763 & 965\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

BHS slows convergence by roughly a factor of four compared with the
baseline (median 166 → 666 epochs), reflecting the need for each
hyperplane to \emph{shrink inward} before it can carve useful regions.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Prototype-Surface Geometry}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=2em]
  \item[Distance clusters]
        All 78 hyperplanes extracted from successful runs fall into
        \emph{one} distance pattern,
        \((d_{0},d_{1})\!=\!(0,1.41)\),
        exactly matching the prototype-surface prediction.
  \item[Weight clusters]
        DBSCAN ($\varepsilon=0.1$) finds \textbf{two}
        sign-symmetric clusters whose centroids are
        $\pm(0.501,-0.501)$.%
  \item[Mirror symmetry]
        Every successful run contains a perfect mirror pair
        (cosine $\approx -1$).%
\end{description}

Thus, when BHS \emph{does} converge, it lands on the
same geometric prototype surfaces as earlier successful methods.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item BHS eliminates dead inputs \emph{by construction} and, while 
      it substantially improves accuracy over the baseline, its $78\,\%$ 
      success rate is lower than that of margin-based re-initialisation.
  \item Geometry of the successful runs is pristine—single distance
      cluster, perfect mirror symmetry—yet the uniform outward
      placement leaves the network prone to an orientation trap that
      rejection sampling rarely encounters.
  \item BHS initialization presents a compelling trade-off. Although 
      its convergence is slower and its 78\,\% success rate is lower than 
      margin-based re-initialisation, it is unique in producing geometrically 
      pristine, perfect mirror-symmetric solutions. Its well-defined failure 
      mode—the orientation trap—makes it a valuable and interpretable technique 
      worthy of further investigation.
\end{itemize}
