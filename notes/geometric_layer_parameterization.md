## Research Proposal: Geometric Parameterization of Neural Network Layers for Improved Orientation Learning

**1. Introduction and Motivation**

Standard linear layers in neural networks parameterize the weight vector $W$ (which defines the hyperplane normal) using its Cartesian coordinates. While effective, there's an intuition that this direct parameterization might not be optimal for learning the *orientation* of the hyperplane. Small changes to Cartesian coordinates can lead to complex changes in orientation, and it's hypothesized that backpropagation might not efficiently or smoothly guide the "rotation" of these hyperplanes.

This research proposes to investigate alternative parameterizations for the direction of the weight vector $W$, drawing from geometrically rich mathematical frameworks: Clifford Algebras (Geometric Algebra) and Lie Groups/Lie Algebras. The central hypothesis is that by parameterizing the orientation of $W$ more directly using concepts of rotation, we might achieve more stable, efficient, or expressive learning dynamics, particularly for tasks where geometric orientation is crucial.

**2. Background Concepts**

* **Standard Linear Layer:** $y = Wx + b$. The vector $W$ acts as the normal to the decision hyperplane (if $b$ is considered an offset or if $y=0$ is the boundary). Its direction determines the hyperplane's orientation, and its magnitude influences the scaling of the output.
* **Decomposition of W:** We can conceptually decompose $W = kU$, where $k=||W||$ is the magnitude and $U=W/||W||$ is the unit vector representing direction/orientation. This research focuses on novel ways to parameterize $U$.
* **Clifford Algebras (Geometric Algebra):** These algebras provide a unified language for geometry, subsuming vector algebra, complex numbers, and quaternions.
    * **Rotors:** In Clifford algebra, rotations are represented by "rotors" (elements $R$ of the even subalgebra satisfying $R\tilde{R}=1$), which generalize unit quaternions to N dimensions. Rotors act on vectors via the geometric product: $v' = Rv\tilde{R}$.
    * **Bivectors:** Infinitesimal rotations or generators of rotations are represented by bivectors. Rotors can be formed by exponentiating bivectors (e.g., $R = e^{B/2}$ where $B$ is a bivector).
* **Lie Groups and Lie Algebras:**
    * **$SO(N)$ (Special Orthogonal Group):** The Lie group of N-dimensional rotation matrices. Elements $R \in SO(N)$ are $N \times N$ orthogonal matrices with determinant +1.
    * **$so(N)$ (Special Orthogonal Algebra):** The Lie algebra of $SO(N)$, consisting of $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrices. It is the tangent space to $SO(N)$ at the identity and represents infinitesimal rotations or "angular velocities."
    * **Exponential Map:** Connects the Lie algebra to the Lie group: $R = \exp(A)$ where $A \in so(N)$ and $R \in SO(N)$.

**3. Proposed Parameterizations for Hyperplane Orientation ($U$)**

The core idea is to learn parameters that define $U$ (the direction of $W$) through these geometric frameworks, and separately learn the magnitude $k$.

**3.1. Clifford Algebra (Geometric Algebra) Approach**
* **Parameterization:** The unit vector $U$ can be generated by applying a rotor $R$ to a fixed reference vector $\mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}}$ (e.g., a basis vector like $\mathbf{e}_1$).
    $U = R \mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}} \tilde{R}$ (or $R \mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}}$ if $\mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}}$ is treated as a multivector element that transforms appropriately).
* **Learnable Parameters:** The rotor $R$ itself needs to be parameterized. This can be done by learning the components of the bivector $B$ from which $R$ is generated ($R = e^{B/2}$). The bivector $B$ in $N$ dimensions has $N(N-1)/2$ components, which can be updated additively.
* **Implementation:**
    * Define layer parameters as the $N(N-1)/2$ components of the bivector $B$.
    * In the forward pass, construct $B$, compute the rotor $R = e^{B/2}$.
    * Generate $U = R \mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}} \tilde{R}$.
    * Combine with learned magnitude $k$ to get $W=kU$.
    * Compute $y = Wx+b$.
* **Gradient Flow:** Gradients would flow back to the components of $B$ and $k$. The derivative of the rotor exponential and the geometric product would be involved.

**3.2. Lie Group / Lie Algebra Approach**
* **Parameterization:** The unit vector $U$ is generated by applying a rotation matrix $R \in SO(N)$ to a fixed reference vector $\mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}}$: $U = R \mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}}$.
* **Learnable Parameters:** The rotation matrix $R$ is generated from an element $A \in so(N)$ (an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix) using the matrix exponential: $R = \exp(A)$. The $N(N-1)/2$ independent components of the skew-symmetric matrix $A$ become the learnable parameters.
* **Implementation:**
    * Define layer parameters as the $N(N-1)/2$ components of $A$.
    * In the forward pass, construct $A$, compute $R = \exp(A)$.
    * Generate $U = R \mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}}$.
    * Combine with learned magnitude $k$ to get $W=kU$.
    * Compute $y = Wx+b$.
* **Gradient Flow:** Gradients would flow back to the components of $A$ (and $k$) through the matrix exponential.

**4. Research Questions and Objectives**

* Can parameterizing hyperplane orientation using Clifford Algebra rotors or $SO(N)$ rotations (via their Lie algebras) lead to more effective or stable learning of orientations compared to standard Cartesian parameterization?
* How do these parameterizations affect the optimization landscape and gradient flow?
* What is the computational overhead and numerical stability of these approaches?
* Can these methods offer benefits in terms of model interpretability, ability to learn specific geometric invariances, or model compression (if $N(N-1)/2 + 1 < N$ for small $N$, though typically it's more)?
* How do these compare to simpler angular parameterizations like hyperspherical coordinates?

**5. Methodology and Experimental Plan**

**5.1. Implementation Details:**
* Develop custom neural network layers in a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
* Implement the construction of rotors from bivectors (Clifford) and rotation matrices from skew-symmetric matrices (Lie algebra), including their derivatives for backpropagation. Libraries for geometric algebra or matrix exponentials might be leveraged or custom-implemented.
* Careful handling of numerical precision and stability, especially for exponential maps and normalization.

**5.2. Datasets and Tasks:**
* **Synthetic Datasets:** Start with low-dimensional (2D, 3D) synthetic datasets where optimal decision boundaries have clear orientations that models must learn. This allows for easy visualization and controlled experiments.
* **Image Classification with Rotational Symmetry/Sensitivity:** Tasks like MNIST with rotated digits, or other datasets where object orientation is a key feature.
* Potentially explore tasks in robotics or physics simulations where orientations are fundamental.

**5.3. Evaluation Metrics and Baselines:**
* **Performance:** Accuracy, loss, convergence speed.
* **Optimization Dynamics:** Magnitude and stability of gradients with respect to orientation parameters, smoothness of learned orientation changes over training.
* **Robustness:** Sensitivity to initialization, learning rates.
* **Computational Cost:** Training time, inference time, memory usage.
* **Baselines:**
    * Standard linear layers (Cartesian $W$).
    * Linear layers with weights parameterized by magnitude $k$ and direction $U$ using hyperspherical coordinates ($N-1$ angles).
    * Weight normalization techniques.

**6. Expected Contributions and Future Work**

* A deeper understanding of the interplay between weight parameterization and learning dynamics for orientations.
* Novel neural network layer designs with potentially improved properties.
* Guidelines on when and how such geometric parameterizations might be beneficial.
* If successful, this could pave the way for more geometrically-aware neural network architectures, useful for tasks requiring robust handling of orientations, rotations, or other geometric features.
* Future work could explore deeper architectures, combinations with other geometric deep learning techniques, and applications to more complex real-world problems.

**7. Potential Challenges**

* **Mathematical and Implementation Complexity:** Both Clifford algebras and Lie theory involve sophisticated mathematics. Implementing them correctly and efficiently, including their derivatives, can be challenging.
* **Computational Overhead:** Generating rotations from bivectors or skew-symmetric matrices (especially via matrix exponentials) can be more computationally intensive than a simple dot product with Cartesian weights.
* **Parameterization Subtleties:** Choosing the best way to parameterize elements within the Clifford or Lie algebra, and ensuring these parameterizations are well-behaved for optimizers.
* **Numerical Stability:** Operations like matrix exponentials can have numerical issues that need careful management.
* **Optimization Challenges:** The new parameter spaces might have their own optimization quirks (local minima, saddle points) that require specific learning strategies.
