## Neural Network Prototype Surface Learning Research Project

This research project investigates the hypothesis that neural networks fundamentally learn prototype surfaces rather than linear decision boundaries. The core theory challenges the conventional understanding that neural networks primarily function by constructing hyperplanes that separate different classes in feature space.

**Core Hypothesis**

Instead of learning linear separations, neural networks learn manifolds or surfaces that represent the characteristic structure and "shape" of where each class naturally resides in feature space. Under this model, classification occurs through proximity or similarity measurements to these learned prototypical representations, rather than by crossing linear decision boundaries.

**Research Goals**

The primary goal is to gather empirical evidence supporting the prototype surface learning theory through systematic experimentation. This is not an effort to definitively prove the theory, but rather to accumulate data, identify new research questions, and provide supporting evidence for this alternative understanding of neural network learning mechanisms.

**Research Approach**

The project employs a series of small, controlled experiments designed to explore different aspects of prototype-based learning. Each experiment targets specific implications of the theory, building a body of evidence through multiple independent investigations. Results will be published as technical reports, contributing to the broader understanding of neural network learning dynamics.

**Significance**

This research could provide new insights into several puzzling neural network behaviors, including the formation of seemingly redundant representations, patterns of robustness and fragility to input perturbations, and the effectiveness of techniques like data augmentation and regularization. Understanding neural networks as prototype learners rather than linear separators could fundamentally reshape how we design, train, and interpret these systems.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
