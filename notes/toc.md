Prelude – Why Geometry?
A short motivation: “Zero activations are not inactivity but membership.”

Chapter 1 – Prototype Surfaces
ReLU, |·|, then bounded activations ⇒ unified view.

Chapter 2 – Pathologies as Geometric Mis-alignments
Dead data, small margins, out-of-bounds neurons, perpendicular traps.

Chapter 3 – Experiments in 2-D (XOR)
Show every failure and fix; introduce monitors.

Chapter 4 – Meta-optimisation
Distance-time law, loss-based sampling, convergence predictors.

Chapter 5 – Dynamic Remedies
Error-driven annealing, magnitude eater, adaptive bias nudges.

Chapter 6 – Extending the Frame
Deeper nets, smooth activations, probabilistic outputs.

Chapter 7 – Practical Check-list
A “geometric debugging guide” for practitioners.

Epilogue – Open Problems & Hypotheses
Your running list of what still bothers you.
